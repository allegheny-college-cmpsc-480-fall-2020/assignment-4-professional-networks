## Overview
 
### Personal networks

Surprisingly, in this year's Stack Overflow Developer Survey (linked above), over 60% of respondents reported that they received information about an open position from personal networks. Versus the 2017 edition of the report, this metric has grown over 40%. Clearly, when folks are looking for jobs, they find them using sources closer to home. 

Now more than ever, having a professional profile on networking sites that you can use as a tool to connect and grow your personal network and/or spread your interests and "brand." This assigment asks you to engage with building a strong profile that you can use as a resource to help you find out information about industries and the opportunities available in them.

In addition, you'll crate a profile on Allegheny's school-specific network, GatorConnect, where you can find opportunities shared directly with the Allegheny community. Also, you'll engage with [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com) -- the largest professional networking site on the Internet.

Now that you have organized professional documents, adapting these to and creating social profiles will be easier. If you already have profiles on these platforms, take this opportunity to revise your current profile to include work you've done on your professional documents.

### Requirements

#### LinkedIn

LinkedIn remains the most popular place for professionals to chronicle their work history, regardless of taking positions in the private or public sector. For this assignment, a full LinkedIn profile should -- at a minimum -- contain:

##### Profile

* A professional photo of yourself
* A unique headline (think about adapting your Developer Narrative Title)
* A professional summary (consider condensing, revising pieces of your Developer Narrative to use here, too)
* Professional Experience (revise and consult your résumé document)
* Education
1. School or program name(s)
2. Dates of anticipated or granted degree/credential
* 5 or more areas of skill or expertise
* List coursework you see as essential/central to the overall story you’ve created in previous assignments
* Current Location
* Projected industry (what field do you want to work in?)
* Join at least 1 educational and 1 profession group
* Make at least 5 new connections (3 or more of which need to be outside of your Allegheny professional network)
* Be sure to list the organizations you’ve been involved in and volunteer work you’ve done during your time at Allegheny; many times this can lead you to opportunities that you’d never consider!

##### Growing your network

* Keep in mind to set a customized, public URL for your LinkedIn profile; because it’s public, it needs to be professional
* Request a connection to your professor–he’s also going to be updating and editing his profile along with you
* If you have good past work experience, ask a former supervisor or co-worker to endorse your skills, especially if it the work experience is related to where you want to end up

#### GatorConnect

GatorConnect is a tool that students can use to connect to other Allegheny students and alumni. Completing your readings this week, the Stack Overflow survey of how folks find jobs and Insights Survey should demonstrate the importance of personal networks. 

As part of your deliverables this week, set up your GatorConnect profile or update it if you already have one.

### Grading criteria

Like many assignments in this course, assessment of this work is based on completeness. I may indicate that you should revise this assignment which is an opporunity to receive full credit for the assignment should there be missing points or content.
